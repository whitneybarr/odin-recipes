                    <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
                    <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
